## 💼 About Me

I'm a dedicated **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** currently working full-time, focusing on AWS cloud solutions, implementing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code deployments, and containerized applications. With 1+ years of hands-on experience, I'm building my expertise in cloud technologies while maintaining a strong foundation in DevOps practices.

My journey has evolved from traditional cloud infrastructure into exploring **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. After earning my AWS Machine Learning certification, I'm now building hands-on experience through practical projects and expanding my skill set into **Kubernetes** and **MLOps practices**. I'm currently preparing for the **CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)** certification while working on ML projects to strengthen my understanding of the full ML lifecycle.

My focus is on gaining practical experience across cloud infrastructure, ML operations, and container orchestration to build well-rounded, end-to-end solutions.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🤖 Enterprise Knowledge Assistant
*AI-powered document search using Amazon Bedrock and OpenSearch*

Built an intelligent system that transforms internal documentation into easily searchable knowledge using natural language queries. The solution leverages AWS Bedrock with Titan embeddings for semantic search, OpenSearch Serverless for vector storage, and DeepSeek as the foundation model. Users can ask questions naturally and receive context-aware answers with source links to original Confluence pages.

**Tech Stack:** Python, AWS (S3, Bedrock, OpenSearch Serverless), Confluence API, React  
**Impact:** Reduced documentation search time from hours to seconds

### 📊 Sentiment Analysis System *(In Progress)*
*ML pipeline for analyzing customer feedback sentiment*

Building an end-to-end ML pipeline to classify customer feedback sentiment using NLP techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training with scikit-learn and TensorFlow, and deployment infrastructure planning. Focus on creating a reproducible pipeline and exploring model versioning and monitoring practices.

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, AWS SageMaker  
**Learning Goals:** End-to-end ML workflow, model evaluation, and deployment strategies
